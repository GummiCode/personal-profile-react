# My Portfolio – React App
https://gummicode.github.io/personal-profile-react/
## Introduction
Hello! I'm David Arrowsmith. I'm a self-trained coding enthusiast. This React app acts as a portfolio of my projects. It has been designed to procedurally generate brief project summary ‘cards’ which include links to my projects’ GitHub repos and deployed versions.

This is a component-based React app with a mixture of hard-coded and procedurally generated content. Styling is implemented using styled-components. 

## Aims
- Create a portfolio with attractive, minimalistic styling
- Implement a single-page continuously scrolling React app
- Practice styled-components
- Include procedurally generated content
- Land my first coding job

## Running the App
The app is hosted on GitHub pages. It can be accessed at https://gummicode.github.io/personal-profile-react/

The app can also be downloaded and run locally:
1. [Clone the app onto your device.](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/cloning-a-repository)
2. Open a bash command terminal.
3. Navigate to this directory’s root.
4. Enter the command ```npm start```. The app will load in your default browser.

## Using the App
Please read from top to bottom, and be sure to check out the links on the project cards. If you’d like to skip straight to the projects (or any other section) you can use the burger menu in the app’s navbar. 

## Next Steps
- The app does not have a complete array of tests. These should be completed.
- The Project cards aren’t ideally proportioned. I’ve begun remedying this but this work is incomplete.
- More & better content is always desireable! This project is a continuous work-in-progress.

# React Portfolio

This repository contains a React app designed to act as a portfolio of my coding work.

## Running the App

The app is hosted on GitHub pages and can be accessed at

https://gummicode.github.io/personal-profile-react/

Alternatively the app can be downloaded and run locally. To do this clone the directory, navigate to it's root in a Bash terminal and run

```npm start```

The app should load in a browser window.
